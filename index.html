 		<h1>Mech Check</h1>
 		<p> This is a browser-based implementation of the Mechwarrior Online mechlab, allowing you to test out the feasibility of various loadouts. Select a standard mech chassis and variant and click 'Go'. Loadouts can also be saved and loaded from browser-based local storage.
 		</p>
 		<p>To create the loadout, click and drag weapons, ammo, and items from the item panel on the right. Items can be removed by clicking the 'x' on their right. Weapons are color-coded and hardpoints are displayed above each component.</p>
 		<h2>Â¡Warning!</h2>
 		<p>This is still a work-in-progress, so be patient with problems. The visual design is also a first pass, and I'm happy to hear your feedback about it. If you do encounter errors, I'd love to hear about them - the more information you can give me, the easier it will be for me to fix. Opening issues on the <a href="https://github.com/neal-erickson/mech-check">github page</a> for this project is the best way to give me error feedback. Otherwise, contacting me on the MW:O forums would be my preferred contact method.</p>

 		<p>Considerations:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>This is a javscript app, so that must be enabled.</li>
 			<li>Currently only tested in Chrome. Firefox and Safari should work.</li>
 			<li>I'm not interested in supporting IE right now. Maybe 10 at some point.</li>
 			<li>Saved loadouts are specific to a domain, so if I have to move it, they will be lost.</li>
 			<li>(in the future, I may implement </li>
 		</ul>
 		<p>Known Issues:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>More than one beagle active probe or ECM can be added.</li>
 			<li>When artemis is added, only using artemis-type ammo is not enforced.</li>
 			<li>Jump jet class is not enforced.</li>
 			<li>Minimum/maximum engine classes are not enforced.</li>
 		</ul>
